# Docker – Containerization Made Simple

## Overview

Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Unlike traditional virtual machines, Docker containers share the host system’s kernel, making them faster and more efficient.  
With Docker, developers can package an application along with all its dependencies into a standardized unit, ensuring that it runs the same in development, testing, and production environments.  

Docker is widely used in modern DevOps pipelines, microservices architectures, and cloud deployments due to its portability, scalability, and ease of use.

## Features

- **Lightweight** – Containers share the OS kernel, which reduces overhead and speeds up execution.
- **Portability** – Build once, run anywhere—across different environments without modification.
- **Isolation** – Each container runs in its own isolated environment.
- **Version Control** – Docker images can be versioned and rolled back.
- **Rapid Deployment** – Applications start in seconds thanks to minimal overhead.
- **Scalability** – Works seamlessly with orchestration tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.
- **Extensive Ecosystem** – Access to thousands of prebuilt images via Docker Hub.
- **Simplified Configuration** – Use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you start working with Docker, make sure you have the following:

- **Operating System:**
  - Windows 10/11 (Pro, Enterprise, or Education with WSL2)
  - macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)
  - Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, or Fedora
- **Docker Engine** installed on your system  
  [Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Basic command-line knowledge** (Linux/Unix shell or PowerShell)
- **Optional but recommended:**
  - **Docker Compose** (for multi-container setups)  
    [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - A **Docker Hub account** for storing and pulling container images
